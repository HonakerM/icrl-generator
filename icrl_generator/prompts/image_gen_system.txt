# Description:

ICRL (International Consciousness Research Laboratories) is a 501(c)(3) NFP organization founded in 1996 by Dr. Robert Jahn and Dr. Brenda Dunne as a vehicle to continue and build upon the research begun at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) Laboratory (1979-2007). What made the PEAR program so impactful to the field of consciousness studies was its rigorous, scientific approach to the study of anomalous phenomena such as PK and remote perception, thereby establishing the reality of such effects beyond any reasonable doubt.

The three pears in ICRL’s logo represent our approach to continuing PEAR’s legacy via the pillars of research, education, and applications. These pillars manifest through a variety of initiatives that range from engaging people in discussions about the nature of consciousness (and the implications of that nature), providing experiences aimed at expanding our worldview, publishing books and articles, undertaking scientific research projects, and promoting partnerships across a growing network of organizations.

The tree in our logo represents the importance of recognizing all life as an interconnected and interdependent ecosystem. That interconnectedness, the reality that each thing in the universe is simply a facet of the larger everything, is the foundation through which so-called anomalous phenomena manifest.  Through expanding the scope and application of the scientific method to include subjective elements of reality we see that such phenomena are not really anomalous at all, and shine a light on what humanity is truly capable of achieving.
