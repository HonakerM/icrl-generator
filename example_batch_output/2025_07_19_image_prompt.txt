Create a serene and vibrant landscape that embodies the concept of mindfulness and presence.

The figure is meditating, with a gentle smile on their face, eyes closed, radiating tranquility and contentment. 

In the background, illustrate a grand tree with sprawling branches and a robust trunk, symbolizing stability and growth. The sky above transitions from a warm golden sunrise to a deep blue, filled with soft, fluffy clouds, suggesting the passage of time and the beauty of the present moment.
